## Clyde Fox Theme Ignores
#
# We ignore four types of files:
#   - Dependencies (dev and prod)
#   - Builds
#   - Environment settings and private data
# 	- OS, editor, and IDE generated files

## Environment files
#
# Not everyone uses the same tools
# in development or production. We ignore
# things like .nvmrc files because projects
# should work in different environments with
# different node versions. Don't lock people
# into using your own personal pet tools.
.nvmrc

## Buids
#
# Builds are ignored because they're not important
# in the context of a repository. Only the development
# versions of files are important. You should be able
# to create identical builds from the same repository
# on any machine. Builds should be distributed outside
# of the context of GitHub. Developers want the code
# to build the project and casual users want the latest
# build without all the development files.
dist/

## Dependencies
#
# Tracking dependencies in your repository only adds
# unnecessary weight to it and increases the chances
# that you end up with a lot of merge conflicts.
# Dependencies should be managed, in this case, with
# npm and Bower and installed/updated as needed by each
# developer.
src/bower_components/
node_modules/

## System/Editor files
#
# Like environment files. Not everyone uses the same editor
# or OS and some files, even if generated by every contributor
# to a project, can be wildly different. One person's .DS_Store
# or .sublime-project files is not likely to be the same as yours.
# Plus it has absolutely nothing to do with the project itself.
# Keep it out of your repo.
.DS_Store
